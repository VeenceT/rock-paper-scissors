// --- PSEUDOCODE ---

// - Make a function that plays a single round of rock paper scissors (singleRound(playerSelection, computerSelection))
// and then return a string that declares the winner of the round like so: "You Lose! Paper beats Rock"
// ---> return the result

// - Ask input playerSelection via prompt("Chose between Rock, Paper & Scissors")
// ---> case insensitive + return the result

// - Make the computer randomly choose rock, paper or scissors (getComputerChoice())
// ---> return the result
